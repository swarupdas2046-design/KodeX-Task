# JavaScript Practice – Arrays & Objects

---


1. Write a function that uses `forEach()` to calculate the total sum of an array.

2. Write a function that uses `map()` to return a new array where each number is squared.

3. Write a function that uses `filter()` to return only numbers greater than 50.

4. Write a function that checks whether two values are strictly equal using `===`.

5. Write a function that demonstrates array mutability by modifying the original array using `push()`.

6. Write a function that removes the last element immutably (without modifying original array).

7. Write a function that sorts numbers in ascending order using a proper compare function.

8. Write a function that sorts strings alphabetically.

9. Write a function that reverses an array without using `reverse()`.

10. Write a function that merges two arrays using `concat()` and returns the result.

11. Write a function that merges two arrays and removes duplicate values.

12. Write a function that manually checks whether a value exists in an array (without using `includes()`).

13. Write a function that uses `includes()` to check if an array contains a specific value.

14. Write a function that filters strings starting with "A" using `startsWith()`.

15. Write a function that uses `find()` to return the first number greater than 100.

16. Create an object and write a function that returns all its keys using a loop.

17. Write a function that adds a new property to an object immutably.

18. Write a function that updates a property in an object.

19. Write a function that checks whether a specific key exists inside an object.

20. Write a function that converts an object into an array of key-value pairs.

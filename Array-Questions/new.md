solve these cleanly using **map, filter, reduce, some, every, find, sort, flat, flatMap**, your array fundamentals will be rock-solid.

### Core Transformation (map mastery)

1. Given an array of prices, return a new array where each price includes 18% GST, rounded to 2 decimals.
2. Convert an array of full names into an array of initials (e.g. "Virat Kohli" → "V.K").
3. From an array of numbers, return an array of objects `{value, isEven}`.
4. Convert an array of strings into their length **only if length > 3**, otherwise `null`.
5. Given an array of dates as strings, convert them into `Date` objects.

### Filtering with intent (filter mastery)

6. From an array of users, return only users who logged in within the last 7 days.
7. Filter out duplicate values from an array **without using Set**.
8. From an array of numbers, keep only those which are prime.
9. Given an array of products, return products that are **in stock AND price < 1000**.
10. Remove all falsy values except `0`.

---

### Aggregation & thinking in reduce (reduce mastery)

11. Find the **sum of even numbers and odd numbers separately** in one reduce call.
12. Convert an array of strings into a frequency object `{word: count}`.
13. Find the **maximum occurring element** in an array.
14. Group users by role (`admin`, `user`, `guest`) into an object.
15. Flatten a deeply nested array **using reduce only**.

### Combined methods (real-world style)

16. From an array of orders, calculate total revenue from only `completed` orders.
17. Given students with marks, return names of students who passed (>40) sorted by marks descending.
18. From an array of comments, return a list of **unique authors**.
19. Given an array of transactions (+/-), check if final balance ever goes negative.
20. Transform an array of numbers into a **running sum** array.

---

### Search & validation (find, some, every)

21. Find the first number divisible by both 7 and 11.
22. Check if **any** user has an unverified email.
23. Check if **all** products have a valid price (>0).
24. Find the first repeating element in an array.
25. From an array of strings, find the first palindrome.

---

### Sorting & structure

26. Sort an array of objects by multiple fields (age ascending, name descending).
27. Rearrange numbers so all negatives come first, positives next (order preserved).
28. Given an array of intervals, sort and merge overlapping intervals.
29. Convert a 2D array into a single array of unique values.
30. Given an array of items with parentId, build a **tree structure**.
